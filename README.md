# Scan Tweaks

My first ever mod for Lethal Company!

At first mostly intended for me to learn a bit about modding c:

Don't hesitate to DM me on discord - saradora - if you have any issues :).

## Features

All features can be toggled in the config file

- Made the ping scan more consistent, allows to scan more than 13 nodes at the same time.
- Made the item radar icons disappear when the player gets eaten.
- Added a scan node on the breaker box.

### Host only features
These features will work if the host has the mod, the other clients do not need the mod

- Fixed the Apparatice price not being set properly (by default ranges from $50 to $140).
- Fixed the Apparatice displaying "???" instead of its price.

## Compatibility

Tested compatible with: 
- HDLethalCompany
- ShipLoot
- HoldScanButton

Unlikely to be compatible with mods that change the player scanner.
