# Scan Tweaks

My first ever mod for Lethal Company!

Intended mostly for me to learn a bit about modding c:

Don't hesitate to DM me on discord - saradora - if you have any issues :), most features were only tested on LAN.

## Features

All features can be toggled in the config file

- Made the ping scan more consistent, allows to scan more than 13 nodes at the same time.
- Made the item radar icons disappear when the player gets eaten.
- Added a scan node on the breaker box.

### Host only features

- Fixed the Apparatice price not being set properly and "???" being displayed

## Compatibility

Tested compatible with: 
- HDLethalCompany
- ShipLoot
- HoldScanButton

Unlikely to be compatible with mods that change the player scanner.
